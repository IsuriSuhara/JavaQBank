//A NullPointerException never occurs because the index expression must be completely evaluated before any part of the
// indexing operation occurs, and that includes the check as to whether the value of the left-hand operand is null.
// If the array reference expression produces null instead of a reference to an array, then a NullPointerException is
// thrown at runtime, but only after all parts of the array reference expression have been evaluated and only if these
// evaluations completed normally.  In an array access, the expression to the left of the brackets appears to be fully
// evaluated before any part of the expression within the brackets is evaluated. Note that if evaluation of the
// expression to the left of the brackets completes abruptly, no part of the expression within the brackets will appear
// to have been evaluated.  Here, m1() is called first, which throws Exception and so a is never accessed and
// NullPointerException is never thrown.  Meaning of "the expression to the left of the brackets appears to be fully
// evaluated":  Consider this line of code: Object o = getArray()[getIndex()]; (Assume that the method getArray returns
// an object array and getIndex returns an int)
// 1. The expression to the left of the brackets is evaluated first. So, first getArray() will be called. This gives the
// reference to the array. It could be null as well. (But if the getArray() method throws an exception, the rest of the
// statement will not be evaluated i.e. getIndex() will not be called.)
// 2. Now, the expression in the brackets is evaluated, therefore, getIndex() will be called, which will give you the
// index. If getIndex() throws an exception then step 3 will not happen.
// 3. Finally, the index will be applied on the array (whose reference was returned in step 1). At this time, if the
// array reference is null, you will get a NullPointerException.
