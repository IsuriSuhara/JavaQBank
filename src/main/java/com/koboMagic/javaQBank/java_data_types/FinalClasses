public class ImaginaryNumber extends Number { //implementation for abstract methods of the base class }
Number is not a final class so you can extend it.

String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer - all are final classes.
1. Remember that wrapper classes for primitives (java.lang.Boolean, java.lang.Integer, java.lang.Long,
java.lang.Short etc.) are also final and so they cannot be extended.
2. java.lang.Number, however, is not final. Integer, Long, Double etc. extend Number.
3. java.lang.System is final as well.
