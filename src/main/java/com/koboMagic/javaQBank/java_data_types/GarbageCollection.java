//When is the Object created at line //1 eligible for garbage collection?
public class GarbageCollection {
    public Object getObj() {
        Object obj = new String("aaaaa");   //1
        Object objArr[] = new Object[1]; //2
        objArr[0] = obj; //3
        obj = null;      //4
        objArr[0] = null;//5
        return obj;      //6
    }
}

//Just after line 5.
//The official exam objectives now explicitly mention Garbage collection.
// All you need to know is:
// 1. An object can be made eligible for garbage collection by making sure there are no references pointing to that
// object.
// 2. You cannot directly invoke the garbage collector. You can suggest the JVM to perform garbage collection by calling
// System.gc();
// After line 3, both, obj and objArr[0] are pointing to the same String object. After line 4, obj points to null but
// objArr[0] is still pointing to the String object. After line 5, objArr[0] also starts pointing to null so there is
// no reference left that is pointing to the String object. So it is now available for Garbage collection.
