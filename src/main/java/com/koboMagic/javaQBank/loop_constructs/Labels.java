//What will it print? (Assume that Math.random() return a double between 0.0 and 1.0, not including 1.0)
//It will not compile.
//Remember that a labeled break or continue statement must always exist inside the loop where the label is declared.
// Here, if(j == 4) break POINT1; is a labelled break that is occurring in the second loop while the label POINT1 is
// declared for the first loop.
